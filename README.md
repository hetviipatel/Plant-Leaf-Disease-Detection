# 🌱 Plant Leaf Disease Detection

A machine learning project to detect plant leaf diseases efficiently using image classification techniques.

---

## 📚 Overview
This project aims to classify plant leaves as healthy or diseased. By identifying diseases early, we can help farmers take necessary actions to save their crops and increase yield.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🌿 Detects multiple types of plant leaf diseases
- 🧠 Powered by Machine Learning / Deep Learning
- 📷 Image-based input
- 📈 High model accuracy
- 🌐 (Optional) Web application integration

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Flask (if building a web app)
